# My implementation of Diffie-Hellman Symmetric Cryptography

Python implementation of Diffie-Hellman according to Wikipedia. \
For educational purposes only. \
Using modulus operator and fast_power algorithm in DH class. \
Proof class is apparently not secure as '''Your “cut” function is essentially implementing a modulus of 10^k. This is insecure because the totient is trivial. ''' @ZK discord
